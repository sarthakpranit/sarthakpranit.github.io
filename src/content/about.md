Design Thinking can't solve every problem. Easy answers usually ignore second-order effects and are wrong. Big problems are messy and subjective, so the process should be too. 

My strength lies in going beyond the standard design process - understanding underlying incentives, engineering and data perspectives, working with research for user insights, then delivering frameworks to discuss various approaches.
